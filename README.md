# CRT Effect
This modifies the framebuffer on Linux systems to produce a CRT screen like effect. This is primarily meant for the RetroPie project, in order to make the emulators look more like their original counterpart, creating a more consistent viewing experience.

Currently only supports 32bpp monitors.
